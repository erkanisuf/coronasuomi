**What about is this app?**
<br />
Corona virus APP , that tracks the data about cases in Finland. It has Statistic char and map of finland with information of statistics for each region in the country. 
<br />

**Why i did it?**
<br />
I learned about REST APIs and how I can use them to get a data from
services. This project was challenging with API`s since some of the data
was not enough from single API , I had to use multiple API calls to
combine the data and create a result/render to the user. Got good
understanding how I could use UI library with React to make a cleaner
look and also to implement a map (in this case map of Finland) with data
on top of it for each region. Got the chance to “taste” the react charts as
well which was very interesting library when dealing with statistical data.
